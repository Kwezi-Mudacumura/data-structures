<h1>My code for creating different data structures which are:</h1></br>
<ul>
  <li>-Vector</li>
  <li>-Linked list</li>
  <li>-Circular array</li>
  <li>-Binary Search Tree</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically these programs are the background to how the data structures are created.</p> <br>I didnt use said data structure to implement the data structure but other data structures and algorithms.
</br>The code also takes into account the time complexity for the best compilation time</p>
