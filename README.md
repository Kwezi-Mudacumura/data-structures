<h1>Data structures coded in c++ :</h1></br>
<ul>
  <li>-<h2>Vector<h2>
  <p>Vectors in C++ are sequence containers representing arrays that can change their size during runtime. They use contiguous storage locations for their elements just as efficiently as in arrays, which means that their elements can also be accessed using offsets on regular pointers to its elements.When I coded this program, I used the implementation of a vector to create my own vector with the following functions:
  <ul>
  <li>  <h3>Constructor</h3>:</br> A vector is constructed with size 0 and the data pointer points to nothing, and counter variables is initialised.
   </li>
   <li> <h3>Destructor</h3>:</br>The destructor frees any memory that is allocated. </li>
   <li><h3>Size:</h3> </br>           </li>




    
  </ul>
  
  
  
  </p>










    
  </li>
  <li>-Linked list</li>
  <li>-Circular array</li>
  <li>-Binary Search Tree</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically these programs are the background to how the data structures are created. <br>I didnt use said data structure to implement the data structure but other data structures and algorithms.
</br>The code also takes into account the time complexity for the best compilation time. </br> Please note that the code is in c++ 11.</p>
